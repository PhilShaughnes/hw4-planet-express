# hw4-planet-express


## Objectives

### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you shouldâ€¦

*   Understand data design
*   Deeply understand ruby style, methods, variables, classes

### Performance Objectives

After completing this assignment, you be able to effectively use

*   ruby on the command line
*   classes, methods, and data
*   comma separated values (CSV)

## Details

### Deliverables

*   A repo containing at least:
    *   `data_parser.rb`
    *   A Class "Delivery", which will represent the rows of that CSV file

### Requirements

*   I should be able to run `ruby data_parser.rb` and see the output on the screen

## Explorer Mode

**Good news Rubyists!**  
We have a week of records tracking what we shipped at Planet Express. I need you to answer a few questions for Hermes.

1.  How much money did we make this week?
2.  How much of a bonus did each employee get? (bonuses are paid to employees who pilot the Planet Express)
3.  How many trips did each employee pilot?
4.  Define and use your Delivery class to represent each shipment

Different employees have favorite destinations they always pilot to

*   Fry - pilots to Earth (because he isn't allowed into space)
*   Amy - pilots to Mars (so she can visit her family)
*   Bender - pilots to Uranus (teeheee...)
*   Leela - pilots everywhere else because she is the only responsible one

They get a bonus of 10% of the money for the shipment as the bonus

## Adventure Mode

*   Define a class "Parse", with a method `parse_data`, with an argument `file_name` that handles output to the console
*   How much money did we make broken down by planet? ie. how much did we make shipping to Earth? Mars? Saturn? etc.

## Epic Mode

*   No `puts` or `print`'s in any method
*   No methods longer than 10 lines long
*   Make `data_parser.rb` executable with a command line argument of the file name

> `./data_parser.rb planet_express_logs.csv`

## Legendary Mode

*   All the above questions should have corresponding class methods in Parse
*   If the script is called with a `report` argument (as in: `./data_parser.rb planet_express_logs.csv report`), the script saves a new CSV file in the current directory with payroll information in the format of: `Pilot, Shipments, Total Revenue, Payment`
